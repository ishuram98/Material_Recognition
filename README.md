# Material_Recognition

A model that can accomplish material recognition using Ensemble Learning (integration of knowledge-based classifiers) to achieve higher accuracy in the prediction and performed analysis between 2 different models to compare their accuracies. The experimental results exhibited that the ensemble feature learning of SVM and logistic regression through ensemble voting classifier achieved higher recognition accuracy of 80.05% than the traditional knowledge-based classifiers.
